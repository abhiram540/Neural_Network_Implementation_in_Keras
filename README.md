# Neural_Network_Implementation_in_Keras
 Keras is one of the most extensible and user-friendly network libraries in the pool of available open-source tools. You saw a little Keras earlier in this course. The beauty of Keras is its modularity; it enables the user to build up a neural network with handy, Lego-like components. Keras has components for layers, activation functions, and optimizers, all of which save you the time (and trouble) of encoding these yourself and making them mutually compatible in a Python script. 

This Notebook will:

- Introduce the Keras library <br>
- Demonstrate data preprocessing on both the train and test sets <br>
- Illustrate how to construct and train a neural network model with Keras functions <br>
- Demonstrate good practices when evaluating neural network models <br>
